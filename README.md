# Volume Scroll

Ever find yourself lying in bed, phone in hand, volume buttons right under your thumb, wishing you could scroll without swiping? Same here. As a late-night webtoon reader, I wanted a way to scroll with just the volume keys—so I built Volume Scroll.

## What is Volume Scroll?
Volume Scroll is an Android app that lets you use your device's volume buttons to scroll content on your screen. No more awkward thumb stretches or accidental taps—just press volume up or down to scroll, anywhere, anytime.

## Features
- **Scroll with Volume Keys:** Use your phone’s physical volume buttons to scroll vertically in any app.
- **Customizable Scroll Distance:** Set how far each press scrolls—make it fast or fine-tuned.
- **Quick Toggle:** Easily enable or disable the service from the app.
- **Visual Overlay:** See when the service is active with a subtle on-screen indicator.

## How to Use
1. **Install the app** on your Android device.
2. **Open Volume Scroll** and enable the accessibility service when prompted.
3. **Adjust the scroll distance** to your liking using the slider.
4. **Start scrolling!** With the service active, use your volume buttons to scroll in any app.

## Why?
Because sometimes, touch scrolling just isn’t it—especially when you’re comfy and the volume keys are right there.

## Permissions
- **Accessibility Service:** Needed to detect volume key presses and perform scrolling gestures.
- **Overlay Permission:** Used to show a small indicator when the service is running.

Of course, this isn’t a perfect solution yet—still working on making it even more comfortable. Stay tuned!
